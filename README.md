## About
This project refactors Horiseon's homepage, refining and streamlining the code in order to improve accessibility and boost SEO. The original code, although it produced a functional page, lacked the details and organization necessary to optimize both the user experience and the page's own SEO quality. As a result, it limited traffic and immediately precluded some users from effectively accessing the page at all, thereby driving down business for the organization.
To address this, I implemented several measures aimed at boosting the overall effectiveness of the page. In accordance with established web accessibility guidelines and this particular User Story, semantic elements have replaced all 'div' tags, offering a more descriptive and logical flow within the HTML. Additionally, redundant and unnecessary selectors were removed from the CSS, increasing the efficiency and readability of the code. Alt attributes have also been added to all images and icons, improving SEO and offering increased accessibility.
