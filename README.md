## About
This project refactors Horiseon's homepage, refining and streamlining the code in order to improve accessibility and boost SEO.
In accordance with established web accessibility guidelines and this particular User Story, semantic elements have replaced all 'div' tags, offering a more descriptive and logical flow within the HTML. Additionally, redundant and unnecessary selectors were removed from the CSS, increasing the efficiency and readability of the code. Alt attributes have also been added to all images and icons, improving SEO and offering increased accessibility.
